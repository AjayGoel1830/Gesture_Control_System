# Gesture_Control_System
B.tech Project

This project presents a Hand Gesture Controlled system using Arduino, which can be
controlled by simple hand wrist movement. According to the movement of the person’s hand wrist, the
accelerometer starts moving. It is based on 3axis of accelerometer and Mechanical system moves in four
direction forward, backward, left and right.
For sensing Human motion, we used MPU-6050 sensor which consists of 3-axis Gyroscope
Accelerometer with Micro Electro Mechanical System (MEMS) technology. This type of Gesture
controlled systems can be used by a person using a wheelchair, military application, industrial robotic,
purpose of surgery, construction field, and entertainment purpose also.

Applications: This project finds applications in:
1.The wheelchair: Gesture controlled wheelchair can be used by elders and disabled people for easy
driving and controlling of wheel chair. They will not be dependent on others.
2.Surveillance: When you want to control the motion of the CCTV cameras, we can use the gesture
control on that system
3.Industrial grade robotic arms: Since we know, while doing welding a lot of harmful gases and radiations
are released which is harmful for the person doing job. So, using this gesture control system, we can
perform MMAW without affecting the human resource.
4.Purpose of Surgery: These systems are used in medical applications for the purpose of surgery, using
gesture control we can optimized the movement of medical tools matching the level of sensitivity
required.
5.Entertainment purposes: Gestures can be used to control interactions for entertainment purposes such
as gaming to make the game player’s experience more interactive or immersive.
